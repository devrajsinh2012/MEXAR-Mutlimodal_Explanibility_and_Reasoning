# Final Year Major Project Showcase

## Project Overview
This document showcases our final year major project, which involves multiple modules designed for multimodal explanations and reasoning. Below we detail all folders of the project, the datasets used, the technology stack, and credits for contributors.

## Project Folders

### MEXAR_Nano
- **Description:** This module is designed to provide lightweight explanations for multimodal inputs. It leverages minimal computational resources while maximizing output clarity.

### MEXAR_Lite
- **Description:** The Lite version focuses on providing streamlined functionalities of the full version but accessible for less-intensive applications. This module is suited for quick insights without deep integrations.

### MEXAR_RAG
- **Description:** The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) module integrates retrieval mechanisms to enhance the generation quality and relevance based on historical data.

### MEXAR_Ultimate
- **Description:** This is the comprehensive version of the MEXAR project, including all features and capabilities. It is designed for advanced users needing thorough explanations and deep integrations with other systems.

## Datasets
- **Dataset 1:** Description of Dataset 1 used in MEXAR_Nano
- **Dataset 2:** Description of Dataset 2 used in MEXAR_Lite
- **Dataset 3:** Description of Dataset 3 used in MEXAR_RAG
- **Dataset 4:** Description of Dataset 4 used in MEXAR_Ultimate
